# PTO System Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a comprehensive PTO (Paid Time Off) system that allows employees to track their PTO balance and request paid/unpaid time off with future balance projections.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **PTO Balance Tracking**
- Created `PTOBalance` model to track:
  - Current available hours
  - Pending hours (reserved for requests)
  - Used hours this year
  - Banking balance for excess hours
- Real-time balance updates via Firestore listeners

### 2. **Future Balance Projection**
- Calculates projected PTO balance based on:
  - Current balance
  - Accrual rate (e.g., 1 hour per 40 hours worked)
  - Target date of time off request
  - Working days between now and request date
- Allows requests using future accrual (e.g., 8 hours requested when only 4 available now, but will have 20 by request date)

### 3. **Time Off Request Updates**
- Added toggle for "Use PTO Balance"
- When enabled, shows:
  - Current PTO balance
  - Projected balance by request date
  - Input for PTO hours (auto-calculated based on duration)
  - Validation messages for insufficient balance
- Stores PTO information with request:
  - `isPaidTimeOff`: Whether using PTO
  - `ptoHoursRequested`: Hours to deduct
  - `projectedPTOBalance`: Expected balance at request date

### 4. **PTO Service**
- Centralized service for all PTO operations:
  - Get current balance with caching
  - Calculate projected balance for future dates
  - Reserve hours when request submitted
  - Deduct hours when request approved
  - Release hours when request denied/cancelled

### 5. **PTO Settings**
- Organization-level settings:
  - Accrual rate and period
  - Maximum balance allowed
  - Banking and rollover policies
  - Yearly allotment option

### 6. **PTO Balance View in Settings**
- Comprehensive view showing:
  - Current available balance
  - Year-to-date summary
  - Accrual policy details
  - Future balance calculator
  - Visual breakdown of balance components

### 7. **Workflow Integration**
- **Request Submission**: Reserves PTO hours
- **Request Approval**: Deducts PTO from balance
- **Request Denial/Cancellation**: Releases reserved PTO
- **Request Updates**: Adjusts PTO reservation as needed

## Technical Implementation

### Models Created:
1. `PTOBalance.swift` - User's PTO balance tracking
2. `PTOSettings.swift` - Organization PTO policy settings

### Services Updated:
1. `PTOService.swift` - New service for PTO operations
2. `TimeOffService.swift` - Updated to handle PTO logic
3. `TimeOffRequest.swift` - Added PTO fields

### Views Updated:
1. `TimeOffRequestView.swift` - Added PTO section with toggle and inputs
2. `PTOBalanceView.swift` - New settings page for PTO balance
3. `SettingsView.swift` - Added link to PTO Balance

## Usage Example

### Employee Workflow:
1. Opens time off request form
2. Sees current balance: "4 hours available"
3. Selects dates 4 months in future
4. Toggles "Use PTO Balance" on
5. System shows: "Projected balance by March 15: 20 hours"
6. Enters 8 hours requested
7. System validates: "âœ“ You will have sufficient PTO by your request date"
8. Submits request (8 hours reserved from future balance)

### Manager Workflow:
1. Reviews time off request
2. Sees employee is using 8 PTO hours
3. Approves request
4. System automatically deducts 8 hours from employee's balance

## Future Enhancements
1. Add PTO accrual processing (automated based on time entries)
2. Implement year-end rollover processing
3. Add PTO balance notifications
4. Create manager dashboard for PTO overview
5. Add PTO reports and analytics
