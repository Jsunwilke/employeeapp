# Tab Bar Settings Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Made TabBarManager a Singleton
- Changed `TabBarManager` to use singleton pattern with `static let shared`
- Updated both `MainEmployeeView` and `SettingsView` to use the shared instance
- This ensures both views share the same state

### 2. Redesigned TabBarConfigurationView UI
- **Removed**: Two-section layout (Selected Features / Available Features)
- **Added**: Single unified list showing all features
- **Added**: Plus/minus icons for each feature:
  - Green plus icon (➕) for unselected features
  - Red minus icon (➖) for selected features
- **Kept**: Reordering functionality for selected items
- **Added**: Live count display "X of 5 selected" with red warning at limit

### 3. Implemented Real-time Updates
- Configuration saves immediately when features are added/removed/reordered
- Updated `BottomTabBar` to observe `TabBarManager` directly
- Changed from passing static `items` array to passing `tabBarManager`
- Tab bar now updates instantly when settings change

### 4. Improved User Experience
- No need to press "Done" for changes to apply
- Visual feedback with disabled plus icons when limit reached
- Cleaner single-list interface
- Immediate reflection of changes in the main app
