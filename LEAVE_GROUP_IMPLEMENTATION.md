# Leave Group Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "Leave Group" functionality as specified in the iOS_CHAT_GROUP_MANAGEMENT.md manual.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatMessage Model (ChatModels.swift)
- Added `leftUserId: String?` field
- Added `leftUserName: String?` field
- Updated `systemMessageText` computed property to handle "participant_left" action

### 2. ChatService Protocol & Implementation (ChatService.swift)
- Added `leaveConversation(conversationId: String, userId: String, userName: String) async throws` to protocol
- Implemented the method with:
  - User validation (must be a participant)
  - Conversation type validation (cannot leave direct conversations)
  - Participant count validation (at least 2 must remain)
  - Removes user from participants array and unread counts
  - Creates system message with "participant_left" action

### 3. ChatManager (ChatManager.swift)
- Added `leaveConversation(_ conversation: Conversation) async -> Bool` method
- Handles local state updates:
  - Removes conversation from local list
  - Clears active conversation if it's the one being left
  - Returns success/failure status

### 4. ConversationSettingsView
- Added `@State private var showLeaveConfirmation = false`
- Added "Leave Group" button section (only shown for groups with 3+ participants)
- Added confirmation dialog for leave action
- Dismisses view after successful leave

### 5. MessageThreadView
- Updated `MessageBubbleView` systemMessageText to handle "participant_left"
- Displays: "[UserName] left the group"

### 6. ChatError Enum
- Added three new error cases:
  - `notAParticipant` - "You are not a participant in this conversation"
  - `cannotLeaveDirect` - "Cannot leave direct conversations"
  - `cannotLeaveLastTwo` - "Cannot leave group - at least 2 participants must remain"

## Fixed Issues
- Removed duplicate `updateConversationName` declaration in ChatServiceProtocol
- Removed duplicate `updateConversationName` implementation in ChatService
