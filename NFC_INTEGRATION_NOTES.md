# NFC Integration Setup Notes

## Info.plist Configuration
Add the following key to your app's Info.plist through Xcode:

```xml
<key>NSNFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses NFC to scan SD cards and job boxes for tracking.</string>
```

## Project Capabilities
In Xcode, enable the following capabilities:
1. Near Field Communication Tag Reading

## Required Frameworks
Ensure the following frameworks are linked:
- CoreNFC.framework

## Entitlements
The NFC entitlement should be automatically added when you enable the capability, but verify it includes:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.formats</key>
<array>
    <string>NDEF</string>
</array>
```

## Testing Notes
- NFC functionality requires a physical device (iPhone 7 or later)
- NFC scanning will not work in the simulator
- Ensure the device has NFC enabled in Settings
