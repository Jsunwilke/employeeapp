# Navigation Fixes Summary - Removed Double Back Buttons

## Fixed Views

### 1. TabBarConfigurationView
- **Issue**: Had its own NavigationView but was presented via NavigationLink from SettingsView

### 2. ConversationListView
- **Issue**: Had NavigationView but was shown within MainEmployeeView's navigation context

## Views Kept As-Is (Correctly Using NavigationView)

These views properly use NavigationView because they're presented as sheets/modals:
- **ConversationSettingsView** - Presented as sheet from MessageThreadView
- **GroupNameView** - Presented as sheet from ConversationListView
- **EmployeeSelectorView** - Presented as sheet from multiple places
- **AddSchoolView** - Presented as sheet
- **Other sheet presentations** - All modal presentations correctly have their own NavigationView

## Rules Applied

1. **Remove NavigationView when**:
   - View is presented via NavigationLink
   - View is shown within an existing navigation context
   - View is displayed as part of the main navigation hierarchy

2. **Keep NavigationView when**:
   - View is presented with `.sheet()`
   - View is presented with `.fullScreenCover()`
   - View is the root view (like MainEmployeeView)
   - View is used in preview providers

## Result
Users will now see only one back button throughout the app, regardless of how deep they navigate into the view hierarchy. The navigation experience is cleaner and more consistent with iOS design guidelines.
